           <h2>Modifications to LoopDA</h2>
		     <p>
		       LoopDA 3.0 is an update to LoopDA 1.0. It is referred to as 3.0, because it utilizes the simulation
			   engine of CONTAM 3.0 to perform the analysis. The following is a list of new features of version
		       3.0. Some of these features were influenced by the feedback provided by a design engineer 
		       who evaluated the usability of version 1.0 [Daly 2003].
			</p>   
			 <h3>Added a Simple Thermal Design Calculation</h3>
			<p>
		       In version 1.0, the user was required to select a design airflow rate and temperature difference
			   based on their judgment or calculations performed external to the program. LoopDA 3.0 now 
			   provides a simple thermal design calculation that determines these values based on a new set 
			   of zone properties including: zone dimensions (floor area and external surface area), minimum 
			   airflow requirements, heat sources and overall heat transfer coefficient of the external surface area.
			   A Simple Thermal Design dialog box provides a list of available loops and associated zones along 
			   with relevant airflow requirements (minimum ventilation rate and cooling load). Users set the 
			   design airflow rate for each loop based on this information then execute the simple thermal 
			   design calculation to: 
			   <ul>
                 <li>balance the airflow through the loops,</li>
				 <li>set the design airflow rates for the natural ventilation airflow components (paths and ducts),</li>
				 <li>perform a steady-state heat transfer calculation to determine the resultant temperature 
                   of ventilation air for each of the airflow components.</li>
			   </ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Modified Loop Drawing</h3>
			<p>
		       In LoopDA 1.0 the user was required to draw the complete pressure loop that started and 
			   ended at the same point on the SketchPad. Now one need only draw an "arrow" that indicates 
			   the intended airflow paths through the building. Drawing begins outside of the building through 
			   the desired flow paths and ducts, and ends just outside the path (or duct) through which the air 
			   is to exit. This approach provides a more conceptual view of how a designer might represent 
			   their intended airflow patterns.
			</p>
			<h3>Integrated Asymptotic Plots</h3>
			<p>
	       		LoopDA 1.0 required the user to export loop data to a text file, import the text file to a 
				spreadsheet template, and then utilize the spreadsheet to generate  so-called asymptotic 
				plots of the relationship between the sizes of the airflow paths and ducts associated with each loop. 
				The need for this cumbersome process has been eliminated. The ability to generate and view 
				these plots has been directly integrated into the program, greatly streamlining the design process.				
			</p>
			<h3>Streamlined LoopDA Interface</h3>
			<p>
				LoopDA 1.0 was largely based on the ContamW code base. This resulted in an interface that 
				contained some unnecessary and somewhat cumbersome features. The following is a list of 
				how the interface has been streamlined:
		   <ol>
					<li>The menus have been reduced to include only LoopDA-related commands.</li>
					<li>The icon placement menu only allows the drawing of LoopDA-related icons: zones, paths and annotations.</li>
					<li>Wind pressure is now simply accounted for via a wind pressure coefficient provided for 
						each individual envelope path or duct terminal.</li>
					<li>Only those flow element types available in LoopDA are listed for selection (orifice, 
						general powerlaw, self-regulating vent). The creation of each flow path or duct now 
						automatically generates a distinct airflow or ductflow element.</li>
					<li>Zone properties have been enhanced to support the simple thermal design calculation.</li>
		   </ol>
			</p>
			<h3>Simplified Analysis Calculation</h3>
			<p>
				The calculations consist only of steady airflow calculations by ContamX, so access to the simulation run 
				control has been omitted. If one wishes to perform a more detailed calculation, 
				the LoopDA project can be saved as a CONTAM project to utilize the full capability of CONTAM. 
				A comparison between the design and analysis values  is provided directly on the SketchPad.
			</p>
			<h3>Added a Self-regulating Vent</h3>
			<p>
				A self-regulating vent airflow component was added based on the work of James Axley [Axley 2001a].
